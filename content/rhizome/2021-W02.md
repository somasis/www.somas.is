- [Should we stop?](http://blog.spencermounta.in/2020/should-we-stop/index.html),
  a really beautifully put together piece thinking about how maybe the world
  must change before software is good.

- [The Default Router](https://tedium.co/2021/01/13/linksys-wrt54g-router-history/),
  an article about how the Linksys WRT54G got famous.

- [90ssamplecds](https://archive.org/download/90ssamplecds/),
  a collection of questionably legal sample packs popular with producers
  in the 1990s. Drink each time you hear the Amen break being passed off
  as a royalty-free sample!

- [ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org/), a double-entry accounting system.
  I recently start using it after some time using
  [Firefly III](https://firefly-iii.org/), which is quite nice but I was curious
  about plain-text accounting stuff.
