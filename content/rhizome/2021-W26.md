# 2021-W26

lookie:

- [sfizz](https://sfz.tools/sfizz/): Open source soundfont player using
  the .sfz format. I like it!

- [qutebrowser](https://www.qutebrowser.org/): Maybe the most promising
  alternative to major browsers. Keyboard-driven, but not restrictively
  so; I've started using it as of late, coming from being a long-time
  Firefox user, and I've really gotten into it.

- [XMascot](http://cclub-flying.dsl.gr.jp/products/xmascot/): The most
  adorable program I've seen yet. I've tried to rehabilitate it a bit at
  [somasis/xmascot](https://git.mutiny.red/somasis/xmascot/), based off
  of the [FreeBSD port's upstream](https://github.com/nyan-/xmascot).
  Featuring my own attempt at translating the Japanese text to English,
  since the documentation had much more detail in its original Japanese
  than the English versions originally included.

things I'm up to:

- I released some music...​
  [somasis - CHAMELEON](https://somasis.bandcamp.com/track/chameleon).

- One of my partners got a PS5 and I've been playing NieR: Automata and
  NieR: Replicant the past few months. They're amazing and I love the
  story and the universe that's been created within the games.

- I stumbled into learning some Perl; I wrote two scripts,
  [mimefilter](http://git.mutiny.red/somasis/me/tree/bin/mimefilter?id=810387ef63a19c509411733b98f19e2eb61c40b1),
  and a script for sending files to the
  [trash](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/trash-spec/trashspec-latest.html),
  as specified by freedesktop.org. I haven't really polished up the
  trash script much (nor am I using it instead of `rm`, yet...​) or else
  I'd link it here.

- Related to the above two points: it turns out getting medication for
  long-undiagnosed ADHD helps. :)
