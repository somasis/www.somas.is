# 2020-W47

lookie:

- [catclock](https://github.com/BarkyTheDog/catclock), an adorable
  xclock fork with a cat...​

- [unix50.org](https://unix50.org/) lets you ssh into old UNIX systems
  going all the way back to UNICS, from the summer of \'69.

- [The Unix Command
  Language](https://susam.github.io/tucl/the-unix-command-language.html),
  the first paper ever published about the Unix shell. written by a
  certain ken thompson in 1976.

- [usand](https://github.com/richfelker/usand), an unshare(1)-based
  sandbox.

things I'm up to:

- I started this lil blog thing.

- I got ahold of
  [The C Programming Language](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/c-programming-language) and
  [21st Century C](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/21st-century-c/9781491904428/),
  and I'l hopefully be reading it while working on some C utilities for
  some Mutiny work. I've got some vague experience working with C when
  it comes to patching other people's projects, but not much in terms of
  writing from scratch.

- Hopefully I will participate in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020)
  for the first time this year?
