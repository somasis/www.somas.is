== Hobbies

* I've been a power user of Linux and UNIX-based systems since I was a young kid.
  My first experience with open-source software was when my grandpa gave me a
  Ubuntu 5.10 live CD that he got sent in a copy of PCMag, I think. I use NixOS
  these days, but I've had experience with Arch Linux, Slackware, Debian, Gentoo,
  OpenBSD, FreeBSD, among others.
