Recently I studied an exerpt from *Dialectic of Enlightenment*, by Max
Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno in class, and recalled something from a
past transgender history class. This is adapted from a writing for that
class that I feel particularly good about.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will draw some comparisons that may appear crude on the surface,
because the comparison between someone's transition and their death has
always been a violent one, but that's the point I'm getting at.

Unfortunately, I can't at the moment find the exact sources which I
first read about this, so I'll be using a source that is not where I
actually first read this. I'll also draw on my own anecdotal experience.

## a past life haunting the present {#_a_past_life_haunting_the_present}

In \"On The Theory of Ghosts\", Sigmund Freud's theory of the belief in
ghosts is discussed:

> At the stages of humanity's development when death still appeared as a
> direct continuation of life, the abandonment of the living in death
> seemed necessarily like a betrayal, and even in enlightened times the
> old belief is not quite extinguished. \[...​\]
>
> \[...​\] It might almost be said that the concept of human life itself,
> as the unity of a person's history, has become invalid: the
> individual's life \[...​\] has lost all continuity between conscious
> remembrance and involuntary memory \[...​\] Individuals are reduced to
> a mere succession of instantaneous presents, which leave behind no
> trace, or rather, the trace of \[...​\] something irrational,
> superfluous, utterly obsolete.
--- On The Theory of Ghosts, Dialectic of Enlightenment

The past is viewed with contempt and is liable to be suspect. As seen
plenty with current online toxic transphobic discussions, with
transphobes insisting they can always tell if someone's trans by their
appearance, their jawline, voice, what have you, this isn't really
something hard to draw connection between. There's plenty of things to
point to as examples of this, and I'm not really going to belabor an
explanation of how people view trans people's lives prior to
transitioning with contempt and a discomfort, if not for sake of post
length then for my own emotional sanctity.

This shows through in how, until maybe just the past six years or so,
often a point of advice among cis people when it came to interacting
with transgender people, there would often be advice to not ask about
someone's backstory, or to see baby pictures, or anything like that.
Obviously, this is not something cis people think to ask often of other
cis people, because they are questions which are grounded in an
expectation that a trans person's history is something which conflicts
with their current appearance and current interpretation by the asker.
The questions are marked with the expectation of a contradiction and
following, a revealing of someone's visible history; the expansion of
the succession of presents with no trace into a contrast which
demonstrates quite clearly, a progression.

I had to show my mom a few timelines of the appearances of trans women
who took hormones to convince her I'd look \"normal\" at the \"end\" of
all of her pain. The perceived gender of the past or the current
(pre/non)-medical transition is viewed with truth, as is the past
perceptions; the true gender of the present is liable to be suspect.

## forget yourself, girl

The text continues...​

> The threateningly well-meaning advice given to emigrants that they
> should forget the past because it cannot be transplanted, that they
> should write off their prehistory and start an entirely new life,
> merely inflicts verbally on the spectral intruders the violence they

> consists largely in the repression of history.

Here I'll be citing a book chapter, [Transgender History in the United
States](https://www.umass.edu/stonewall/sites/default/files/Infoforandabout/transpeople/genny_beemyn_transgender_history_in_the_united_states.pdf),
by Genny Beemyn.

The fact that Adorno was writing this section during his time in
California after escaping Nazi Germany is obviously not something I
desire to co-opt or appropriate by comparison, but this \"threateningly
well-meaning advice\" is not unique to people who have emigrated, which
I don't think is controversial to point out.

I say this because not too long ago (the 1960s-1980s), transsexual
people were explicitly encouraged by physicians and medical
professionals to hide and lie about their past. They were told to invent
a childhood matching their post-transition gender, sever ties with old
friends and make new friends with people who didn't know them prior to
transition, change jobs, even move to another city to avoid the
possibility of being outed.

> Given the extreme social stigma against transsexual people, many did
> not need much encouragement to \'disappear\' if they could.

--- \"The Post-Christine Era\", page 18, Transgender History in the
United States, Genny Beemyn

And I say not too long ago, but this is not a long ago thing. I will go
back to the baby pictures and the questions about childhood: the way
transphobia from the cis inquirer is avoided in lieu of their actual
understanding and acceptance of a transgender person's history, is
through the trans person's forgetting and a repression of their
prehistory.

The comparison between the dead and the transgender person here is not
simply that, because we also see it in terms like \"deadname\" (a
transgender person's former name, if they changed it), or in the way
[it's not at all
uncommon](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/opinion/sunday/gender-transition-death-grief.html)
[for parents to
react](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/07/i-love-my-trans-daughter-but-im-still-struggling/613786/)
[to their child's real gender
identity](https://www.justplainbeth.com/you-can-grieve-and-support-your-child/)
[with a sense their actual child is
dying](https://www.sciendo.com/article/10.2478/genst-2020-0011). Of
course, even a term like deadname isn't meant literally---​one can easily
reject the idea that because they've come out, the old them is dead, yet
can still use the word \"deadname\" without having a problem with it.

I still get this sentiment on rare occasion in part because my own
coming out coincided with moving off to college, and because I changed
my name after moving up here; if your mom thinks you became much more
argumentative when you moved away, imagine how curious it must be to be
accused of being more argumentative because you're no longer pretending
to identify to her or anyone else as a man.

Even recounting that, I can see that I myself even did this: move to
another city to avoid the possibility of being outed, developing new
friendships, and so on, though no one told me to do that. A clean slate.
The person who the past gender used to inhabit is viewed as a ghost,
because society wishes not to interact with or give an accepted
continuity to their life through a time of transition---​they repress
history in themselves in fear that disintegration will cause a new
disintegration.
