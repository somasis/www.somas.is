Most of my projects are immaterial right now.
[I'm looking for work please hire me.][LinkedIn]

Here's everything I've done:

[Organizing your Nix configuration without flakes]: note-organizing-nix-configuration-without-flakes.html

- In 2025, I wrote a blog post: [Organizing your Nix configuration without flakes].
- In 2024,
  I finally, finally, finally, graduated from Appalachian State University
  with a B.A. in Philosophy, minoring in Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies.
  I am a better person for it.
- In late 2023,
  I presented my capstone to Appalachian State University's
  Department of Philosophy and Religion. It was titled "Beyond Plunderphonics:
  A prolegomena to any future revolutionary music."
- In early 2023, I presented a paper at the 23rd annual
  Southern Appalachian Undergraduate Philosophy Conference, which took place at
  UNC Asheville. It was titled "Whatever's Left of Woman." It won first
  place.
- In 2022, I started using NixOS.
  I'm a contributor to [nixpkgs].
  I have a kinda decent understanding of the Nix language at this point,
  having had no prior experience with functional programming paradigms.
  [Here's my NixOS configuration][puter].
- In 2022, I translated [`catgirl`][catgirl],
  a terminal-based IRC client that I use developed by my friend [june],
  [to Toki Pona][catgirl-tokipona].
  It's kinda outdated right now but it got the job done.
  I still use `catgirl`.
- In 2021, I made [hunspell-tok][hunspell-tok],
  a Toki Pona dictionary for [`hunspell(1)`](http://hunspell.github.io/),
  a popular spell checking library used by many open-source projects.
- In 2021, I made [discord-theme-irc][discord-theme-irc],
  a custom CSS stylesheet for Discord that makes it look a little more
  like an IRC client usually does.
  It's obsolete because I don't really have the energy to maintain it and
  keep it working, and Discord is proprietary software that's constantly
  changing. I do use some custom CSS on Discord still, though.
- In 2021, I made [discord-tokipona][discord-tokipona],
  a plugin for Powercord (a Discord client mod) that provided an unofficial
  Toki Pona translation for the client, doing most of the translation myself.
  It was forked from the
  [original author's plugin](https://github.com/cominixo/tokipona-discord),
  after I found it and saw it was relatively unmaintained.
  I began working on it to improve and further flesh out the translation of
  Discord's official English strings into Toki Pona (a conlang which I had
  learned over the last year). Eventually, I drifted away from the primary
  toki pona Discord a little, and the plugin was obsoleted by the discontinuation
  of Powercord itself; I didn't really have the motivation to get it working on
  a new client mod, because Discord client mods come and go so much.
- In early 2021,
  I hit the big time and [got to make a set for WNYU][Live from the New Afternoon Show],
  the college radio station of, yes, NYU.
  Then later that year, [I released another single][Chameleon].
  And [a cover of a song by another well known artist in the pony music
  scene][Season Infinity (replacer cover)].
  And then...​ I lost a lot of steam, finally, and started focusing more
  on my philosophy degree.
- In mid 2020,
  [I did an unofficial remix of a Sweet Trip song I liked][Dedicated (somasis remix)].
  Later that year [I worked on a song with an idol of mine][Starsailor].
  In late 2020, I put out [a companion EP][in nature, together] to my
  previous album ([spirit / songs for lovers]) that I still like.
  At the tail end of 2020,
  [I covered a song by an idol of mine][Dashy / Hearth's Warming Eve],
  and I still really like what I did with their original song.
- In 2020, I got bored and wrote a reimplementation of
  [`pass`](https://passwordstore.org) that would use
  [`age`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) instead. But it was mostly
  just an experiment; I couldn't really get off of using `pass`, and
  GPG, consequentially, because there's just no real support for that
  workflow on a mobile device. It was called
  [`passage`][passage], and it was superceded
  anyway (same name even!) by a more recent project doing the same thing
  by the author of `age`.
- In 2019, [I made my first real single][january], and then my first Real Album,
  [spirit / songs for lovers], which might be the only thing you've heard by me.
  A few months later, it got a little buzz and it gave me way too much of an ego
  boost and I didn't really know what to do after that!
- In 2017-2020, some time after I stopped actively developing for
  Exherbo Linux, I started trying to create my own Linux
  distribution---my ultimate project in my quest to reinvent every wheel
  that was Not (yet) Invented Here. I called it
  [Mutiny](https://github.com/somasis/meta/blob/main/mutiny.7.adoc), and
  it was more so a practice in system designing and documentation
  writing. I was a very clever girl: documentation was written with
  AsciiDoctor, so as to be available both as webpages and as manual
  pages on the system;
  `s6` was to be the primary `init(8)` system,
  and the administrator would interact with system services, user services,
  a user's X session, and timed jobs using an `s6` frontend called `commune`;
  `snooze` would be used rather than `crond`,
  since it integrated much more flexibly with `s6`, and fit the [DJB]-type of
  simplicity I really wanted to make a legitimately usable testbed for;
  CI for the distribution would be managed using a very minimalistic
  daemon called [`laminar`][ohwgiles/laminar] that looked cool and
  tried to follow a Unix Philosophy type design very closely;
  packages would be written using a bespoke format inspired by KISS Linux and Exherbo's exheres-0 format,
  named [`theory`](https://github.com/somasis/praxis/blob/main/theory.5.adoc);
  even better, the package manager would be called [`praxis`][praxis];
  musl libc would be the preferred standard C library,
  `toybox` would provide coreutils,
  `execline` would be the primary system scripting language,
  and LLVM/clang/libc/lld would be the C/C++ toolchain;
  there would be an emphasis on better support for internationalization
  than most systems of this breed would usually provide,
  and _all_ documentation would be provided in `mandoc` format,
  no GNU Info or anything like that.
  Most importantly, it had a very cool logo.
  It got nowhere, but it was fun to have a hobby horse for a while.
  The toolchain was one of the biggest timesinks,
  and the extreme amount of flexibility I shot for in the system packaging
  was a really tough thing to implement with my programming skills at the time,
  realistically.
  That said, I still think a lot of these ideas really ought to be realized by
  people with more time and energy than me.
- In 2018,
  [I finally caught my breath and did a remix of a song for a friend][Boundary ft. ANDR (somasis remix)].
  And then [two more remixes of one song][Hawk and Crow (somasis remixes)],
  the same year.
- In 2017,
  [I did a song for a Pinkamena Party compilation][INCOHESIVE HORSE ADHESIVE].
  And [a two track single][sunraiser / revolution means beauty].
- In 2016, I worked on converting the old MediaWiki used by the musl
  libc project (after it fell into disrepair by its administrator) to a
  more hip technology: a static Markdown wiki. I wrote the tools to
  build it myself, because I felt that other site generators of that
  type felt a bit overengineered. You can check out the wiki
  [here][musl-wiki]. The tools I wrote, named
  [`makedown`][makedown] are available as
  well, but poorly documented unfortunately. I don't really work on it
  anymore, having handed over maintainership to other people in the
  developer community around 2021, if I remember correctly.
- In 2015, I put a small `curl` wrapper ([`wget-curl`][wget-curl]) that would
  translate `wget`-style arguments to their equivalents in `curl` syntax
  on GitHub.
  Later (and without my knowing), it was included in CyanogenMod for a time,
  and was [later removed][wget-curl-removal] after issues with users tripping
  over it, since I believe the developers of CyanogenMod mostly started using it
  for replacing `wget` in the system tool set somewhere.
  I was an enthusiastic user of the [Toybox] project (an alternative to `busybox`) at the time,
  and wrote the script primarily as an experiment of my own,
  for until Toybox got its own `wget` reimplementation;
  I was in the process of trying to enable `toybox` to provide a
  `coreutils` alternative on Exherbo Linux.
  - I also lightly ported FreeBSD's `libarchive`-utilizing `unzip` implementation,
    and I called it [bsdunzip].
- In 2015, I wrote a silly little init daemon called [beginning];
  it was a fun project but I eventually realized that
  [`s6`][s6] was a much more
  technologically superior solution for the problem space of process
  supervision. Unfortunately, this did not translate into me doing
  anything to integrate `s6` more properly into my distro of the time,
  but I really wanted to! I still use `s6` in 2025, though not as an
  init system, I just find many of its tools useful; I had to concede my
  technical preferences for getting things done long ago.
- In 2015, for making it easier to deal with Gerrit, I wrote [git-gerrit],
  which was a wonky little script to automate interacting with with Gerrit
  over its SSH frontend.
- And also in 2015 (I had a lot of free time) [I started making a fork...​
  thing...​ of my favorite GTK theme set of the time][shiki-colors-revival],
  Shiki-Colors (also known as [GNOME-Colors][gnome-colors]).
  I still use some variation on this theme, but I've not really published it
  anywhere.
- In 2015, [I did some more tracks for a Gak Attack Records
  compilation][Gak Attack vol. 2], our final release it seems.
- At the end of 2014,
  I wrote a script for updating the Linux kernel from source,
  called [`lux`][lux],
  primarily for users of Exherbo Linux (but it worked with any distro; it was
  just for fetching and configuring and building the kernel from Git).
- In 2014, I wrote a Tumblr theme called Bootstrapped---it was actually
  in the theme gallery for a time too.
  [Here's what it looked like.][bootstrapped-demo]
- When 2014 came, and I made
  [an EP][Acetate 2014],
  [another EP][The Infinite Sadness]),
  and what I felt was [my first actually good album-length album][Live from the Tapedeck Spaceship].
  Then for some reason [I released some rejects from that album][Rejected from the Tapedeck Spaceship].
- In 2013,
  [I made some of my first music][3'48 Shark];
  then, [an EP][sleepless];
  then, my first [album][the lonesome planetarium];
  then, [another album][talent show].
  then, [some remixes][talent show: the remixes];
  then, a [silly][i'm no jungalist massif] EP;
  then, [a song and a half for a Pinkamena Party album][RAINBOW DASH IMPALES HERSELF];
  then, [my first reasonably good album][A Most Beautiful Sight]
  (and I think that one's my girlfriend's favorite);
  then, a song that would be on an album I'd release the next year in 2014
  ([Live from the Tapedeck Spaceship]) was released on [Pinkamena Party's
  third compilation][Academy of Booty];
  then, [one last EP][Scattered, We Unified];
  then, I worked with some friends from the Brony music scene on an
  IDM/breakbeat hardcore netlabel called Gak Attack Records,
  and we did that thing computer musicians do when they come together,
  and [we made a compilation][Gak Attack vol. 1] that was pretty good.
- Back in 2012, I wrote a set of scripts for a Minecraft server plugin
  called CommandHelper, called [rccmd], which provided a set of general
  commands for server users and administrators, as an alternative to more
  full-featured command set plugins of the time.
- Back in 2011 (I think), I made a GNOME Shell theme called Seeha, but I
  can't find an archive of it anywhere.
  [There was an AUR package for it, though][gnome-shell-theme-seeha].
  It was put on DeviantArt, but in the years since, I deleted my account.
- In 2011, I made a custom theme for the Wii menu, called [Simplicity].
  It was posted on a forum I was involved in, named WADder, which, if I
  remember correctly, was a forum for Wii homebrew enthusiasts who were
  mostly interested in the idea of modding system components, like the
  Wii's own system menu, or through the creation of custom channels. The
  technology for creating custom channels with animations and all was
  relatively young, but had recently become much more accessible for
  people with little coding experience.
  The theme download still works, if you can figure out how to install it!
- My most obscure flex is that [in 2010 I got published in OMGubuntu][Meet Alawalk]
  for a dinky little shell script launcher program called Alawalk,
  [and its update][Alawalk update],
  and [then that launcher program got remade][lauf]...​
- In 2008, at the ripe age of 10, I made an account on MFGG---Mario Fan
  Games Galaxy---and published a really poorly made game made by Game
  Maker, [Super Mario Bros. Remasted!].
  It got rave reviews:

  > Upon hitting the Quit Button, \"You want to quit this awesome
  > game?\" popped up in front of me. I'm still not sure what game it
  > was talking about.
